# dbt_shopify v0.7.0
## ðŸŽ‰ Documentation and Feature Updates
- Updated README documentation updates for easier navigation and setup of the dbt package
- Included `shopify_[source_table_name]_identifier` variable within the Shopify source package for additional flexibility within the package when source tables are named differently.
- **New model alert**: The package now includes customer models that are based on _email_ rather than _customer_id_ ([PR #45](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_shopify/pull/45)):
  - `shopify__customer_emails`
  - `shopify__customer_email_cohorts`
  - Intermediate models that roll customer_ids up to emails:
    - `shopify__customer_email_rollup`
    - `shopify__emails__order_aggregates`

    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`

- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

# dbt_shopify v0.6.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_shopify_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_shopify_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

- The `union_schemas` and `union_databases` variables have been replaced with `shopify_union_schemas` and `shopify_union_databases` respectively. This allows for multiple packages with the union ability to be used and not locked to a single variable that is used across packages.

# dbt_shopify v0.1.0 -> v0.5.2
